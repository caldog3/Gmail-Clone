For the Message Mockup, you'll need an email address with
the important folder empty.

The first mockup screen, MockupMessage1.png, is what happens when you first log in.

The second mockup screen, MockupMessage2.png, is found by clicking on 
Private Messages. Then in UtlityBar.vue line 207, uncomment out visiblity:hidden;
