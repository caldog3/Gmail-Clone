With MockupEmail, you'll want an email where all emails you want
designated encrypted are unread, and are the only emails unread.
These emails also need to be in important and the only emails in 
important.

Whether or not the encrypted lock symbol appears on an email in 
Emaillist depends on if its read or not. Then the Private folder
is actually important.
